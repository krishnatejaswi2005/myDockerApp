# üê≥ Docker Practice Project

This is a Docker practice project built to understand how to containerize a Node.js backend with MongoDB using Docker and Docker Compose. The frontend is a React app (Vite).

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project contains:

- **Backend**: A Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database.
- **MongoDB & Mongo Express**: Deployed using Docker Compose.
- **Frontend**: A Vite-powered React app.

You‚Äôll learn how to:

- Create and use Dockerfiles
- Use Docker Compose for multi-container setups
- Understand Docker commands and syntaxes

## üê≥ What is Docker?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs (libraries, dependencies, etc.) and ship it as one package.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dockerfile: Full Explanation

```dockerfile
FROM node:24.1-alpine3.21
```

- `FROM`: Specifies the base image (lightweight Alpine Linux + Node.js 24.1). Every image starts from a base.

```dockerfile
ENV MONGO_DB_USERNAME=admin \
    MONGO_DB_PWD=password
```

- `ENV`: Declares environment variables inside the container.

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p docker Backend
```

- `RUN`: Executes a command in the container at build time. Here, it creates nested folders `docker/Backend`.

```dockerfile
COPY . docker/Backend
```

- `COPY`: Copies files/folders from local machine to container image.

```dockerfile
CMD ["node", "docker/Backend/index.js"]
```

- `CMD`: Sets the default command to run when the container starts. Uses exec form (`["executable", "param1"]`).

### Other Dockerfile Keywords (Not used here but important)

| Keyword      | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `WORKDIR`    | Sets the working directory inside container   |
| `EXPOSE`     | Documents which port the container listens on |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Provides more control over command execution  |
| `LABEL`      | Adds metadata (e.g. version info)             |
| `ARG`        | Declares variables only during build time     |

## üß± docker-compose (mongo.yaml) Explained

```yaml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
```

### YAML Keywords

- `services`: Top-level key to define each containerized service.
- `image`: Pulls image from Docker Hub.
- `ports`: Maps host:container ports.
- `environment`: Passes environment variables into container.

```yaml
mongo-express:
  image: mongo-express
  ports:
    - "8081:8081"
  environment:
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: admin
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: password
    ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://admin:password@mongo:27017/
```

- The mongo-express connects to the `mongo` service using internal Docker DNS.
